        Perfect typography depends on perfect harmony between all of its elements. 
        Harmony is determined by relationships
        or proportions. Proportions are hidden everywhere. words themselves.

        True book design, therefore, is a matter of tact (tempo, rhythm,
        touch) alone. It flows from something rarely appreciated today:
        good taste. The book designer strives for perfection; yet every
        perfect thing lives somewhere in the neighborhood of dullness and
        is frequently mistaken for it by the insensitive. In a time that
        hungers for tangible novelties, dull perfection holds no
        advertising value at all.

        In a masterpiece of typography, the artist's signature has been
        eliminated. What some may praise as personal styles are in reality
        small and empty peculiarities, frequently damaging, that masquerade
        as innovations.

        Only through constant practice and strictest self-criticism may we
        develop a sense for a perfect piece of work. Unfortunately, most
        seem content with a middling performance. Careful spacing of words
        and the correct spacing of capital letters appear to be unknown or
        unimportant to some typesetters, yet for him who investigates, the
        correct rules are not difficult to discover.

          <span class="fw6">For us Graphic Design is “organization of information.”</span> There are other
          types of graphic design more concerned with illustration or of a
          narrative nature.  Nothing could be more useful to reach our intention
          than the Grid. The grid represents the basic structure of our graphic
          design, it helps to organize the content, it provides consistency, it
          gives an orderly look and it projects a level of intellectual elegance
          that we like to express.  There are in nite kinds of grids, but just
          one - the most appropriate - for any problem. Therefore, it becomes
          important to know which kind of grid is the most appropriate. The basic
          understanding is that the smaller the module of the grid the least
          helpful it could be. We could say that an empty page is a page with an
          in nitesimal small grid. Therefore, it is equivalent to not being
          there. Conversely a page with a coarse grid is a very restricting grid
          offering too few alternatives. The secret is to  nd the proper kind of
          grid for the job at hand. Sometimes, in designing a grid we want to
          have the outside margins small enough to provide a certain tension
          between the edges of the page and the content. After that we divide the
          page in a certain number of columns according to the content, three,
          two, four,  ve, six, etc. Columns provide only one kind of consistency,
          but we also need to have an horizontal frame of reference to assure
          certain levels of continuity throughout the publication. Therefore, we
          will divide the page from top to bottom in a certain number of Modules,
          four, six, eight, or more, according to size and need. Once we have
          structured the page, we will begin to structure the information and
          place it in the grid in such a way that the clarity of the message will
          be enhanced by the placement of the text on the grid. There are in nite
          ways of doing this and that is why the grid is a useful tool, rather
          than a constricting device.

          Back in the office after his vacation on a 154-foot rented yacht named Mister Terrible, he feels that relaxation slipping away. He feels pulled inward, toward his own most valuable and destructive traits. Slights roll through his mind, eating at him: worst record ever, can't build a team, absentee landlord. Jordan reads the things written about him, the fuel arriving in a packet of clips his staff prepares. He knows what people say. He needs to know, a needle for a hungry vein. There's a palpable simmering whenever you're around Jordan, as if Air Jordan is still in there, churning, trying to escape. It must be strange to be locked in combat with the ghost of your former self.

          The memories came to him, how he felt then. "It was very pure, if I can say it right," he'd explain later. "It was pure in 1984 … I was still dreaming." During the Olympics, he was deep in negotiations with Nike for his first shoe contract. He traded pins with other athletes. Eight years later, when he was the most famous person in the world and the Dream Team was forced to stay outside the Olympic Village, he'd be disappointed when that separation kept him from swapping pins again.

          There's an unspoken shadow over the stories about that town house on Essex Drive. James Jordan remodeled the basement for his son. Did all the work himself, because he'd never let Michael pay for something he could do on his own. The first winter, while Michael was out of town for the All-Star Game, his pipes froze. His dad ripped out the walls, replacing the pipes himself, patching and repainting when he finished. He spent two weeks fixing his son's home. James and Mike -- that's where all this nostalgia has been headed, from the moment it began.
